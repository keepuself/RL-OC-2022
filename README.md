# RL-OC-QCar-test
### Introduction
To verify the control performances of the developed approximate RL-based control policy, trajectory tracking experiments are implemented by a car-like vehicle named as QCar (Quanser self-driving car), The results show that the proposed control scheme has better trajectory tracking performances with intelligence, optimization, accuracy under input constraints.
